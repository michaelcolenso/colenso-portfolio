### Project Overview

**HYATT PLACE HOTEL & APTS | SEATTLE | $40M | HOSPITALITY | MULTI-FAMILY**

This project involved the construction of a multi-use development combining hotel accommodations and residential units. As Project Manager, I was responsible for overseeing construction activities, ensuring efficient scheduling, and managing multiple change directives during the final phases of the project. My implementation of the Last Planner System enabled the team to deliver the project two months ahead of schedule while accommodating over $4M in late scope changes.

**Key Responsibilities and Achievements:**

- Spearheaded the implementation of the **Last Planner System**, resulting in an aggressive, yet achievable, construction schedule that led to substantial completion two months ahead of the original timeline.
- Managed construction of a combined **hotel and multi-family development**, ensuring that both components met high standards of quality and functionality.
- Successfully negotiated and integrated 25 Construction Change Directives in the last four months of the project, adding $4M in scope changes without affecting the overall project delivery.
- Collaborated closely with hotel operators, residential stakeholders, and city officials to ensure that the project complied with both hospitality and multi-family residential requirements.
- Delivered a high-quality hospitality and residential complex that balanced the needs of hotel guests and long-term residents, blending functionality with aesthetic appeal.

> "Incorporating major scope changes late in the project required tight coordination and a focus on efficiency, all while keeping the project on time and within budget."

The success of the **Hyatt Place Hotel & Apartments** project showcases my ability to manage complex, multi-use developments and accommodate significant changes without compromising on quality or timelines.
