### Project Overview

**255 S. KING ST | SEATTLE | $200M | HOSPITALITY | HIGH-RISE**

This project involved the construction of a 600,000 SF high-rise development in Seattleâ€™s Pioneer Square, consisting of two concrete towers: a 23-story Embassy Suites hotel and an 18-story office tower/parking garage, connected by a 10-story glass atrium. As Project Manager, I oversaw the successful completion of this complex, large-scale development, coordinating a vast team of subcontractors, engineers, and city officials to ensure seamless execution.

**Key Responsibilities and Achievements:**

- Led the construction management for two interconnected towers, totaling 600,000 SF, in Seattle's densely populated downtown area.
- Coordinated with the design and engineering teams to ensure the glass atrium seamlessly connected the two towers while adhering to strict structural and safety guidelines.
- Implemented value engineering strategies, achieving significant cost savings without compromising the project's quality or timeline.
- Spearheaded stakeholder communication efforts, keeping the client, city officials, and other project partners informed of progress, budget updates, and any critical changes.
- Delivered both towers on schedule and within budget, navigating complex logistical challenges inherent to constructing in a densely populated urban environment.

> "A project of this scale requires not only technical expertise but also the ability to manage relationships with numerous stakeholders, ensuring a smooth path to success."

The successful completion of 255 S. King St demonstrated my ability to manage and deliver complex, high-rise construction projects, navigating both the technical and managerial challenges of such large-scale developments.
